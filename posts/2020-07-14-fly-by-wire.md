## Show Notes

Immediately after attending RPI in upstate New York, Brian moves to Ithaca to develop thermal printer firmware. Feeling a bit lonely in Ithaca, Brian moves to Binghamtom to work with an old friend developing safety-critical autopilot features. After two years in Binghamton, Brian moves back home to Long Island to work with his father's 30-year-successful development shop writing software for the facility maintenance industry.
