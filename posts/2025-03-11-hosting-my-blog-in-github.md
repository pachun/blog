# Hosting my Blog in Github

I'm trying out hosting my blog directly in a GitHub repository. I've used GitHub Pages in the past and several other blogging tools in the past. The trouble is, I often forget to write for a while. Then the thought of updating the blog with a new post becomes a bigger chore in my mind and prevents me from doing it. Is my version of Jekyll out of date? Did my syntax highlighter break? Am I still happy with my dark mode theme?

My hoping is that switching to hosting the blog directly in github will get me writing more often. Now, the only tools involved in writing a new blog post are tools I already use and love every day. Neovim and git are always up to date and I'm never scared to use them.

GitHub .md files aren't exactly intended for this, but for my purposes, since I'm familiar with git/GitHub, it'll make the thought of writing a positive one, rather than a fear-riddled one.

Things I don't have to worry about anymore:

- Outdated blogging tools: I don't use any; Everything is Markdown
- Hosting: GitHub does it
- Color schemes: GitHub provides them
- Syntax Highlighting: GitHub is great at it
- SEO: Github does it

New things to worry about:

- I will have to manually keep things like the [index page]() in sync with the posts.
- I will have to manually keep post document title dates and in-document dates in sync.

I'm not too concerned about those. If I forget to do something or do something wrong, I'll probably spot it. If I don't, when I do, it will be simple to fix. I think this is a good tradeoff. At least, I'm going to try it.
