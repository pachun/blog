# Hosting my Blog in Github

_March 3rd, 2025_

I'm testing out hosting my blog in a GitHub repository. Like - directly in a GitHub repository. This one. No GitHub Pages. No Jekyll templates. No build tools.

Sometimes I forget to write a post for a while. After that, when I do decide that I have something worth writing about, there are mental (and real) blockers on getting to the actual writing. Those concerns are sort of similar to picking up work on a project that hasn't seen any commits in a few months.

> I don't like my dark theme anymore. Jekyll is out of date. My domain is expiring soon. My SEO isn't great. My syntax highlighting is attrocious.

Moving to GitHub to host the blog, right in a repository, removes all those concerns. Github manages all of that for me. **The only tools I need working in order to get a new post published is git and neovim**. I use those everyday. I take care of them. It's never been months since I touched them. I'm hoping this will remove the mental, "cosmetic" and build-tool related blockers I find myself addressing when posting for the first time in a while.

Yes, I'll need to manage some things manually, like linking to a new post from the [index](/README.md) page (which is actually a `README.md` file) and linking back to to all posts at the bottom of each post. I think it's unlikely that I miss something like that, but when I do, it will be simple to fix. Everything's just markdown.

For now, I think it's worth the tradeoff and I'm going to try it. I'll get back to you.
